# Earthquake
This project contains a set of observations (strictly confined to Astronomical and Astrological subject) which were noted during an event of earthquake. Analysis of Vedic Astrological charts of some of Earthquakes of magnitude more than 7 along with some prominent Astronomical parameters have been documented. The outcome of the analysis have been listed out in a separate folder, which hopefully after a sufficient number of data points and confirmations, can give us more "out of box" understanding about the causes of Earthquakes comparing to the facts known to us as of now.
